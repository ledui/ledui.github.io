      <h1>Introduction to Green Code</h1>
      <br />
      <p>This document explains the basics of Green Code and some of
      the design decisions that were made. If you just want to get
      started, you might be better off just consulting
      the <a href="/dictionary/">Green Code Dictionary</a>.</p>

      <h2>Why is it called Green Code?</h2>

      <p>The primary reason is, of course, because of its potential
        use in environmentally friendly low-power LED Grid based
        applications, and the obvious Matrix allusion.</p>

      <p>In an early 8x1 version, all the characters were in green,
        but since we moved to a 4x1 RGB format, we found that blue and
        red gave a greater contrast against the white plastic LED
        housing that many of the common devices have. However, as we
        shall see, the green square is the most important control
        code, so there is still quite a bit of the colour green in
        Green Code.</p>

      <h2>What is Green Code?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-1">
          <div class="row" id="row5"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-11">
          <p>Green Code is a visual language with each character
            represented by four coloured squares in a 4x1 grid (like the
            long thin block in the video game Tetris).</p>

          <p>There is also an <a href="/whitecode/">alternative black and white representation</a>
            which uses a 4x2 grid for each character. Obviously this is 50%
            less space efficient, but it can be used on single colour
            (i.e. on and off) LED grids without having to learn a second
            visual language.</p>

          <p>Green Code provides a lot of characters, which aim to
            more or less represent the first block of characters in
            Unicode. This first block is formally known as ISO/IEC
            8859-1 but is commonly referred to as 'Latin alphabet
            no. 1' or as 'Western European languages'. This block
            provides the characters needed for 28 languages and
            partial support for 13 more.</p>

          <p>Obviously, you only need to learn the characters useful for
            your own language(s). If like me your primary language is
            English, you only really need to learn the 26 letters, 10 digits
            and a few punctuation characters.</p>

          <p>If you want to encode a non-Latin script language
          (e.g. Chinese), then you will need to invent your own
          encoding. If you do, then please let me know, it would be
          pretty interesting to see what you come up with!</p>

      <h2>What are the basics?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-0"></div>
          <p>The character shown above represents a space. It
            is four blank squares. A blank square represents an LED
            turned off, they are white here because this web page
            happens to white; if the background of this page was
            black, these blank squares would be black.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-1"></div>
          <p>This is the letter e. It has one blue square (and three off
            squares). The colour blue represents dark or short (aka dot/dit).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-2"></div>
          <p>This is the letter t. It has one red square (and three off
            squares). The colour red represents light or long (aka dash/dah).</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-3"></div>
          <p>Now blue-red or (or short-long or dit-dah) is a. As you
            may have already noticed, the English characters are based
            on morse code.</p>
          <p>Extra characters such as digits were fairly sensible in
            Morse's original 1844 code, but when it became standardised
            in 1865, it became the proverbial horse designed by
            committee.</p>
          <p>The digits and punctuation characters got longer and
            longer. The problem being, that when you break the 4
            character max-length, a longer character risks being
            mistakenly decoded instead as two constituent characters,
            e.g. the word 'he' and the number 5 are both five dots
            (blue).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row center-block" id="rowsos"></div>

          <p>This ambiguity would be compounded in Green Code as we use
          spaces between words, not between characters.</p>
          <p>Above is a word in Green Code, as you can see, characters
          are built up vertically and then combined horizontally to
          form words.</p>

        </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="/images/picard.png" width=300 height=300 />
        <p>Therefore in Green Code, the character length is always
        four, and extra colours are used to extend the character
        set. Mostly these extra colours are used in the top position, so you
        can treat them like 'control characters' to distinguish
          between different blocks of characters.</p>
        <p>So if a character starts with blue or red, it is probably a
        basic letter. If a character starts with green, it is probably
          a digit and so on.</p>
      </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Digits</h2>
      <div class="row" id="digits-row"></div>
      <br />
          <p>Digits all start with a green square. If you know Roman
            numerals, the three lower squares are very simple.</p>

          <p>If you look at the character 0, it has a green square and
            three blank squares.</p>

          <p>Now look at the character 1. It has a blue square in second
            position. You can think of it like I in Roman numerals.</p>

          <p>Now look at the character 5. It has a red square in second
            position. You can think of it like V in Roman numerals.</p>

          <p>8 is the one that doesn't immediately translate to Roman,
            however I like to pretend there is another (hidden) red square
            below it, i.e. IIVV, and V+V=X so IIX which is 8 (correct
            Roman 8 is VIII of course, but that doesn't fit either).</p>


          <h2>Letters</h2>
          <p>Here are the English characters in Green Code. Like in
          Morse Code, there is no upper and lower case, only one case,
          which for uniformity, we always represent in letters as
            lower case. </p>
          <p>For most of human history, they did without an upper and
          lower distinction, you won't miss them. Also note that the
          alphabet is typically not the best layout for
          learning.</p></p>
          <div class="row" id="letters-0"></div>
          <div class="row" id="letters-1"></div>
          <div class="row" id="letters-2"></div>
          <h2>More</h2>
          <p>Carry on by looking at the full <a href="/dictionary/">Green Code Dictionary</a>, or look at <a href="/hundred/">some common words</a>.</p>
