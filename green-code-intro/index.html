      <h1>Introduction to Green Code</h1>
      <br />
      <p>This document explains the basics of Green Code; if you
        already know about it, you might want to skip the text and
        just scroll down to look at the pictures!</p>

      <h2>Why is it called Green Code?</h2>

      <p>The primary reason is, of course, because of its potential use
        in environmentally friendly low-power applications, as mentioned
        below, and the obvious Matrix allusion.</p>

      <p>However, as we shall see, the green square is the most
        important control code, so there is a lot of the colour green in
        Green code.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Green Code?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-1">
          <div class="row" id="row5"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-11">
          <p>Green Code is a visual language with each character
            represented by four coloured squares in a 4x1 grid (like the
            long thin block in the video game Tetris).</p>

          <p>Green Code is particularly aimed at the kind of 8x8 or 8x4
            LED Grids that are commonly connected to single board computers
            or micro-controllers, but you can also use it on a normal
            computer using your normal screen.</p>
      
          <p>There is also an alternative black and white representation
            which uses a 4x2 grid for each character. Obviously this is 50%
            less space efficient, but it can be used on single colour
            (i.e. on and off) LED grids without having to learn a second
            visual language.</p>

          <p>Green Code provides a lot of characters, which aim to
            more or less represent the first block of characters in
            Unicode. This first block is formally known as ISO/IEC
            8859-1 but is commonly referred to as 'Latin alphabet
            no. 1' or as 'Western European languages'. This block
            provides the characters needed for 28 languages and
            partial support for 13 more.</p>

          <p>Obviously, you only need to learn the characters useful for
            your own language(s). If like me your primary language is
            English, you only really need to learn the 26 letters, 10 digits
            and a few punctuation characters.</p>
          
          <p>The rest of this simple introductory document focuses on
            English. If your language is not English, I would love you to
            make your own introduction to Green Code that focuses on the
            characters you need. Also feedback or suggestions on the use of
            Green Code in other languages will be gratefully accepted. I
            would also love to hear about any similar efforts in non-Latin
            languages (e.g. Chinese), it would be pretty interesting to see
            how you could encode those in LED form.</p>
        </div>
          
      <h2>Why was Green Code Invented?</h2>
      
      <p>I realised that my Raspberry Pi Sense HAT, an 8x8 LED Grid,
        used 25 times less power than my little DSI touchscreen and
        50 times less power than my HDMI monitor.</p>
      <p>Having spent my whole childhood playing Tetris, my brain is
        already trained to read coloured blocks from a grid. Therefore
        I decided to see how far I could push the concept of using an
        LED grid. Could it replace a monitor in my house, saving
        electricity and thus helping the planet?</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="figure"><img src="/images/sensehat1.png" width=300 height=300 /></div>
          <div class="caption">
            <p>This was my first attempt at an LED grid based
              notification application.</p>
            <p>It aimed to show me a visual summary of my
              communications while away from my main desk, e.g. on the
              breakfast table, etc.</p>
            <p>The symbol in the top right is telling me that today it
              will be cloudy with rain (i.e. it is actually meant to
              be a little picture of a rain cloud).</p>
            <p>However, I can cheer up because the two columns of
              stacked dots are telling me I have five emails in my
              Gmail and three Twitter notifications.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="figure"><img src="/images/sensehat2.png" width=300 height=300 /></div>
          <div class="caption">
            <p>The next logical step was to be able to read email subjects,
            tweets, etc on the device. So when I selected a dot using a
            joystick, it would scroll the text across the screen using
            large letters.</p>
          
          <p>This however was slightly slow and fragile, i.e. if in my
            impatience, I got bored and moved my gaze away, I could
            easily lose a few characters and have to wait until it had
            finished scrolling and then start it scrolling all over
            again.</p>

          <div class="caption">
            <p>What I really wanted was a way to have several
            characters on screen at one time. I realised that if each
            character was encoded in a vertical 4 square block, I
              could see up to 16 characters on screen at once.</p>
            <p>Later, come back and see if you can read this message.</p>

            <p>Green Code clearly takes off, especially in the 23rd
            Century. Enterprise science officer and first officer
            Spock, has all the information he needs from four colour
            matrices. No fancy pictures, no talking robots, no
            holograms.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, Matt Jefferies, art director and
            production designer on the original Star Trek series was a
            distinguished World War II aviator, and took the concept
            of 'space navy' seriously in his designs, using military
            technology and design principles.</p>

      <h2>Why use Green Code?</h2>
      
      <p>Obviously, this is a whimsical endeavour, and is meant to
      be fun. A load of weird lights is an entertaining but very niche
      way to read. If you didn't leave at the sight of images of Spock
      and the Matrix above, then you probably are the right person to be
      here.</p>

      <p>It might be difficult to read War and Peace with this format,
        but it works quite well for: "rain 20 degrees, meeting at 11,
        don't forget the milk" or whatever you want to be notified
        about.</p>

      <p>Building my low-power grid based UI is a work in progress and
        it is somewhat off topic to go into further detail
        here. However, if you find a use for Green Code or build an
        application that uses Green Code, I would love to hear about
        it.</p>
      
      <h2>What are the basics?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-0"></div>
          <p>The character shown above represents a space. It
            is four blank squares. A blank square represents an LED
            turned off, they are white here because this web page
            happens to white; if the background of this page was
            black, these blank squares would be black.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-1"></div>
          <p>This is the letter e. It has one blue square (and three off
            squares). The colour blue represents dark or short (aka dot/dit).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-2"></div>
          <p>This is the letter t. It has one red square (and three off
            squares). The colour red represents light or long (aka dash/dah).</p>       
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row" id="basics-3"></div>
          <p>Now blue-red or (or short-long or dit-dah) is a. As you
            may have already noticed, the English characters are based
            on morse code.</p>
          <p>Extra characters such as digits were fairly sensible in
            Morse's original 1844 code, but when it became standardised
            in 1865, it became the proverbial horse designed by
            committee.</p>
          <p>The digits and punctuation characters got longer and
            longer. The problem being, that when you break the 4
            character max-length, a longer character risks being
            mistakenly decoded instead as two constituent characters,
            e.g. the word 'he' and the number 5 are both five dots
            (blue).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="row center-block" id="rowsos"></div>

          <p>This ambiguity would be compounded in Green Code as we use
          spaces between words, not between characters.</p>
          <p>Above is a word in Green Code, as you can see, characters
          are built up vertically and then combined horizontally to
          form words.</p>
            
        </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="/images/picard.png" width=300 height=300 />
        <p>Therefore in Green Code, the character length is always
        four, and extra colours are used to extend the character
        set. Mostly these extra colours are used in the top position, so you
        can treat them like 'control characters' to distinguish
          between different blocks of characters.</p>
        <p>So if a character starts with blue or red, it is probably a
        basic letter. If a character starts with green, it is probably
          a digit and so on.</p>
        <p>There are actually exceptions to this rule, but don't run
        before you can walk.</p>
      </div>       
      </div>
 

      
      <h2>Digits</h2>
      <div class="row" id="digits-row"></div>
      <br />
          <p>Digits all start with a green square. If you know Roman
            numerals, the three lower squares are very simple.</p>
          
          <p>If you look at the character 0, it has a green square and
            three blank squares.</p>
            
          <p>Now look at the character 1. It has a blue square in second
            position. You can think of it like I in Roman numerals.</p>
          
          <p>Now look at the character 5. It has a red square in second
            position. You can think of it like V in Roman numerals.</p>
          
          <p>8 is the one that doesn't immediately translate to Roman,
            however I like to pretend there is another (hidden) red square
            below it, i.e. IIVV, and V+V=X so IIX which is 8 (correct
            Roman 8 is VIII of course, but that doesn't fit either).</p>

            
          <h2>Letters</h2>
          <p>Here are the English characters in Green Code. Like in
          Morse Code, there is no upper and lower case, only one case,
          which for uniformity, we always represent in letters as
            lower case. </p>
          <p>For most of human history, they did without an upper and
          lower distinction, you won't miss them. Also note that the
          alphabet is typically not the best layout for
          learning.</p></p>
