      <h1>LED UI Ports</h1>
      <p>In recent years we have become spoiled with exciting devices.</p>
      <p>The main and only (so far) port being developed is in Python
        on Linux due to the ease of development, but it can be
        easily(ish) ported to other languages and platforms by anyone
        who is dedicated enough to do it.</p>
      <p>It will be quite a while until this first port is stable as
        it is being developed as a hobby in spare time, however, we
        are hoping that eventually even crazier people can make their
        hobby porting LED UI to their favourite devices and operating
        systems.</p>
      <p>Also we are willing to add new platforms as core ports if
        they prove themselves useful.</p>
      <table class="table">
        <tr>
          <th>Port Name</th>
          <th>Image</th>
          <th>Comments</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>
            <p>The initial and main port of LED UI is to Linux. Most
              people are interested in the Raspberry Pi single board
              computer (in its various form factors).</p>
            <p>However, there are other small single board computers
              that can run Linux. Also a desktop computer
              can <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ledgrid/">emulate
              an ledgrid.</a> and so run LED UI on a
              monitor. Obviously that is not particularly power
              efficient or portable, but is an easy place to
              start.</p>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ESP8266</td>
          <td><img src="/images/esp8266.png" width="300" height="300" /></td>
          <td>
            <p>This is a interesting platform as it has a low power
              micro-controller with a fairly generous amount of RAM
              and has built-in Wifi. The MicroPython folks are aiming
              to support it and it also supports other easy languages
              such as C and Lua.</p>
            <p>We are watching this platform and hope to test LED UI
              on it, especially if we can prototype an initial version
              in MicroPython.</p>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>BBC Microbit</td>
          <td><img src="/images/bbcmicrobit.png" width="300" height="300" /></td>
          <td>
            <p>A great device, and I got mine free for volunteering to
              teach teachers how to use the Microbit at an
              event. Obviously 2 characters at a time removes some of
              the efficiency of Green Code but it is still fun.</p>
            <p>The form factor and design are excellent. While this
              cannot support the LED Menu; loading a single
              small game or application is certainly possible.</p>
            <p>This platform is one to watch, as if they bring out
              future versions with higher specifications then it will
              become much more useful.</p>
            <p>It has two programmable buttons, but the accelerometer can
              be used for more input.</p>
            <p>I used MicroPython, which really brings the device
            alive.</p>
