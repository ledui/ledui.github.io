      <h1>Introduction to the LED UI Project</h1>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This website is about making applications for the kind of 8x8
      or 8x4 LED Grid <a href="/devices/">devices</a> that are
      available for single board computers or micro-controllers, but
      you can also them on a normal computer using your normal screen,
      for example by
      using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ledgrid">ledgrid</a>
      to emulate an LED grid.</p>

      <p>Obviously, this is a whimsical endeavour, and is meant to be
      fun. A load of weird lights is an entertaining but very niche
      way to read and interact with a computer.</p>

      <p>It might be difficult to write a sequel to read War and Peace
        with this format, but it works quite well for: "rain 20
        degrees, meeting at 11, don't forget the milk" or whatever you
        want to be notified about.</p>

      <p>As well as notifiers, an LED grid application could be a nice
      music players, a game, anything you can imagine.</p>

      <p>If you are making an application for LEDGrids, I would love
        to hear about it.</p>



      <h2>Why are we here?</h2>

      <p>I realised that my Raspberry Pi Sense HAT, an 8x8 LED Grid,
        used 25 times less power than my little DSI touchscreen and
        50 times less power than my HDMI monitor.</p>
      <p>Having spent my whole childhood playing Tetris, my brain is
        already trained to read coloured blocks from a grid. Therefore
        I decided to see how far I could push the concept of using an
        LED grid. Could it replace a monitor in my house, saving
        electricity and thus helping the planet?</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="figure"><img src="/images/sensehat1.png" width=300 height=300 /></div>
          <div class="caption">
            <p>This was my first attempt at an LED grid based
              notification application.</p>
            <p>It aimed to show me a visual summary of my
              communications while away from my main desk, e.g. on the
              breakfast table, etc.</p>
            <p>The symbol in the top right is telling me that today it
              will be cloudy with rain (i.e. it is actually meant to
              be a little picture of a rain cloud).</p>
            <p>However, I can cheer up because the two columns of
              stacked dots are telling me I have five emails in my
              Gmail and three Twitter notifications.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="figure"><img src="/images/sensehat2.png" width=300 height=300 /></div>
          <div class="caption">
            <p>The next logical step was to be able to read email subjects,
            tweets, etc on the device. So when I selected a dot using a
            joystick, it would scroll the text across the screen using
            large letters.</p>

          <p>This however was slightly slow and fragile, i.e. if in my
            impatience, I got bored and moved my gaze away, I could
            easily lose a few characters and have to wait until it had
            finished scrolling and then start it scrolling all over
            again.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <div class="figure"><img src="/images/sensehat3.png" width=300 height=300 /></div>
          <div class="caption">
            <p>What I really wanted was a way to have several
            characters on screen at one time. I realised that if each
            character was encoded in a vertical 4 square block, I
              could see up to 16 characters on screen at once.</p>
            <p>Later, come back and see if you can read this message.</p>

            <p>LED UI clearly takes off, especially in the 23rd
            Century. Enterprise science officer and first officer
            Spock, has all the information he needs from four colour
            matrices. No fancy pictures, no talking robots, no
            holograms.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, Matt Jefferies, art director and
            production designer on the original Star Trek series was a
            distinguished World War II aviator, and took the concept
            of 'space navy' seriously in his designs, using military
            technology and design principles.</p>

            masks and weapons using these four little panels. I don't
            want to spoil the plot, but we can say it is the last
            display a Predator will ever need.</p>
