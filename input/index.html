      <h1>Input Devices</h1>
      <p>For user input, LED UI is based around having a joystick and
        buttons.</p>
      <p>The simplest thing is to just use an old PS3 controller but
        anything that works with Linux can probably be made to work with
        LED UI, for example there are some small and pocket-able USB
        gamepads being made or you can soldier your own buttons using
        Raspberry Pi GPIO. In this page, I list some common approaches.</p>

      <table class="table">
        <tr>
          <th>Device name</th>
          <th>Image</th>
          <th>Buttons</th>
          <th>Comments</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sense HAT Joystick</td>
          <td><img src="/images/sensehat-list.png" width="300" height="300" /></td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>
            <p>Four directions and a central push down button. LED UI
            is easier with a few more buttons; however, it will work
            with just this one button, so you can start with this one
            button and if you grow to like LED UI, get some more buttons
              later.</p>
            <p>The Sense HAT only uses two pins, so there are plenty
            of pins left for adding extra buttons. This is how the
            next example works.</p>

          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>AstroPi 3D printed case</td>
          <td><img src="/images/astropi.png" width="300" height="300"
          /></td>
          <td>11</td>
          <td>
            <p>11 buttons (including 5 button joystick above). This is
              the ultimate in self contained space style LED use.</p>

            <p>Not exactly the quickest way to get started as it
              involves soldering and bending GPIO headers etc, so you
              might want to use a gamepad (see below) first.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Official PS3 Controller</td>
          <td><img src="/images/official-ps3.png" width="300"

          <td>25</td>
          <td>
            <p>25 buttons/stick directions, but you can also use
              diagonals to emulate 40 (this applies to the others
              below also). Using a gamepad, especially if you have an
              unloved one in the cupboard already, is a quick way to
              give your LED device a load of buttons.</p>

            <p>The official PlayStation 3 controller uses Bluetooth,
            which is built into the Raspberry 3. Other models of Pi
              need a Bluetooth adaptor, but they can be quite small.</p>

            <p>PS3 controllers are widely available on auction sites,
              as well as in second-hand shops, etc.</p>

          <td>Third Party PS3 Compatible Controller</td>
          <td><img src="/images/sixaxis.png" width="300" height="300" /></td>
          <td>25</td>
          <td>
            <p>Back in the day when PS3 official controllers were
              expensive, third-party controllers were widely used.</p>

            <p>This one came from the UK shop called Argos and uses RF
              instead of Bluetooth, it came with its own (4-5 cm long)
              receiver USB dongle.</p>

            <p>I have this one and it happens to work. I cannot speak
              for all third-party controllers. Until you plug it in, it
              may be hard to figure out what it actually is and if it
              has a Linux driver. The company out in China probably only
              tested it with a Playstation, so may have introduced some
              subtle incompatibility that stops it working in Linux.</p>

            <p>It is a bit of a punt. So if you have a third-party
              controller already, use it, but it is not worth buying a
              third-party one unless it is substantially cheaper than
              you can get an official PS3 controller for, and PS3
              controllers are a third of the price they used to
              be.</p>

            <p>Comes in a wired and a wireless version. The former
            just plugs into a USB socket, the latter uses a
            proprietary RF format which needs a "Wireless Gaming
            Receiver for PC" which plugs in your device's USB
            socket.</p>
            <p>360 controller is not quite as cheap as the PS3 ones,
            but otherwise comparable to it.</p></td>

              you can use cursor keys as your joystick.</p>

            keyboards available for portable use.</p>
